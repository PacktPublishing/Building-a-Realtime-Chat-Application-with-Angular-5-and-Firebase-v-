## About the Video Course
Angular 5 is a structural framework for building dynamic web applications. If you’re facing a challenge in building robust and efficient web applications with Angular 5, then look no further as this video course will enable you to get to grips with Angular 5 by enabling you to build a realtime chat application using Angular 5, Angular CLI, Bootstrap 4 and Firebase. Initially, you will quickly scaffold a new Angular application using Angular CLI and then, you’ll add Bootstrap 4 and a few other dependencies to build your application rapidly. On your journey, you will create new pages, implement routing, authentication and more. Next, you’ll work on setting up a new Firebase account and integrating the Firebase backend into your Angular 5 application.
As you progress further, you will make use of a Reactive pattern and implement Observables to add realtime capabilities to your chat application. In addition to building a realtime chat room, you will also build user profile pages; implement a search engine for users and learn how to the send direct messages to users. Towards the end of this course, you will be able to build a fully featured realtime chat application using Angular 5 and Firebase and deploy it to AWS so that the world can see it.
